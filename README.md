# nlp_social_robotics
Verbal communication in robotics: a review about fields of applications and trends in the last decades based on computational linguistic analysis.

Dataset:

- Data_VC_AMV contains data divided on publication years or divided in groups (Contrast analysis). The NLP tool T2K has been used to perform this analysis.

- The other three form all together the main corpus (topic mining). data_speech_robot1 has to be merged together with data_speech_robot2000 and data_speech_robot2019. R was used to perform this analysis.

The R script used for the analysis can be asked by sending an e-mail to alessandro17mv@gmail.com
